- 👋 @csdropout1 ~ aka the one and only microl. As of 2023, no one else has that name !!!
- 👀 Some things I do here and there, feel free to check them out! Star some of them to help my much needed ego boost! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build basic GUI with python as well as unity to create video games.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a youtube channel actually - nothing to do with CS (but with video games too if you are a creative writer/artist).
- 📫 How to reach me: If you really want to reach me, I am sure that you'll find a way ♥ ♥
